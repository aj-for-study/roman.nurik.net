This is the source code to my personal site, [roman.nurik.net](http://roman.nurik.net). It's
basically just a single responsive page that has some text and a bunch of external links.

The project was built using the [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/),
so the build system is [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). To build the site (which gets output in the
`dist` directory), just run

    gulp
